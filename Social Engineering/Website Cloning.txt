    # or you can just use this fake webpage with a typosquatted url
# open up terminal, go to your Desktop "cd /home/kali/Desktop/SocialEngineering/"
# run cmd, "sudo python3 -m http.server 80"
# go back to firefox and type in your IP
    # go to no-ip.com, click domains, search if typosquat urls are available

    # upload .html as the website page
# navigate to login with email or username
# input credentials
